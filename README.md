# ML-Research-Paper-with-Sensor-Data
I need to wrote a paper about the following experiment I ran. I am good at experiment but not at writing. I dont wanna use ChatGPT since all the conference use AI detection tool to catch these kind of stuff. I am kinda in a hurry. Need the first draft by monday. Final paper could be a week or 2  later its fine.  You can just check my github repo for exaplnation and experiments I ran (https://github.com/ashish-saha/Subject_Recognition_Using_LSTM_for_HAR_Dataset). This is what I wrote so far

Activity & Subject Detection with predicted Sensor Data


I am using Human Activity recognition dataset with by UCI (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/240/human+activity+recognition+using+smartphones) to write my paper. The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
LAYING
STANDING
There were 30 participants and each person performed the activities wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy s2) on their waist. The dataset has 10299 entries & 561 features divided into train and test for classification purposes

There are two major problem that we identified with the HAR dataset
Majority of prior research on HAR dataset focuses on activity recognition, but we plan to use to the dataset to recognize the activity and subject performing the activity
There is also very little research on how to deal with missing sensor data. In real life sensors fail thus making it difficult to do any sort of prediction  

Evaluation
    I used LSTM to do both classification. Look at the results here (https://github.com/ashish-saha/Subject_Recognition_Using_LSTM_for_HAR_Dataset)
        Activity recognition was straightforward 93% accuracy
        Subject recognition was tricky The UCI HAR dataset is primarily designed for activity recognition, not subject recognition. While it does include subject identifiers, the distribution of subjects between the training (21 subjects) and testing (9 subjects) datasets is uneven, with no explicit focus on ensuring uniform subject representation across both sets. So I combines both train and test set and split the data so both train and test have all 30 subjects. I did the split 80/20. The accuracy was 80% which is good since random would have been 1/30=3.3%
               If we look at the subject class accuracy per activity then the picture becomes much more clear. For all subjects its the sitting, standing and laying classes thats causing issues. Since these are stationary activity it might look very similar across all subjects (Look at my github for charts)

Missing Data Simulation
    The dataset is sampled at 50 HZ. So 50 times per second. And out of the 562 features, 345 were related to accelerometer and 213 were related to gyroscope. My whole idea was for a couple of seconds (it could be 1-10 seconds) one of the sensor fails. For example 5 seconds of accelerometer data went missing and 5 seconds of accelerometer data went missing. I used “SimpleImputer” and “KNNImputer” with and without PCA (principal component analysis) to fill in the missing data and then use the model to evaluate.

    For activity recognition baseline accuracy was 93 %, with missing data the accuracy was 78% and with imputed data with 90 % (not bad)
     For activity recognition baseline accuracy was 80 %, with missing data the accuracy was 61% and with imputed data with 73 % (also not that bad)

Activity and Subject Detection with Predicted Sensor Data Using LSTM on HAR Dataset
Abstract

In this paper, we investigate the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to perform both activity and subject recognition on the Human Activity Recognition (HAR) dataset. The HAR dataset, collected from 30 participants performing six activities of daily living (ADLs) with a waist-mounted smartphone, is traditionally used for activity classification. However, little research has focused on the simultaneous recognition of both activities and subjects, particularly in the context of missing sensor data, which is a common challenge in real-world applications. We address these issues by implementing an LSTM model and exploring data imputation methods to handle missing sensor data, assessing the performance of both tasks under various conditions.
Introduction

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its applications in health monitoring, smart homes, and wearable technology. The UCI HAR dataset, which captures the movements of participants performing various activities with embedded inertial sensors, has been a widely used benchmark for activity recognition tasks. The objective of this study is to extend the traditional activity recognition task by incorporating subject recognition, where the model must not only classify the activity being performed but also identify the subject performing the activity. This extension is particularly challenging due to the uneven distribution of subjects across training and testing datasets. Additionally, we explore the problem of missing sensor data, a common issue in real-world scenarios, and evaluate various imputation strategies to address this challenge.
Dataset and Preprocessing

The UCI HAR dataset consists of 10299 entries and 561 features, collected from 30 participants using a Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone. The dataset includes six activities:

    Walking
    Walking Upstairs
    Walking Downstairs
    Sitting
    Laying
    Standing

Each participant performed these activities, and the data was split into training and testing datasets. The challenge lies in the uneven distribution of subjects across the training and testing sets—21 subjects in the training set and 9 in the testing set. The original HAR dataset does not explicitly balance these distributions for subject recognition, which presents an additional difficulty in subject classification.

To address this issue, we combined the training and testing sets and performed a uniform 80/20 split, ensuring that all 30 subjects were represented in both training and testing datasets. This approach allowed us to perform both activity and subject recognition tasks effectively.
Problem Identification

We identified two major problems with the UCI HAR dataset:

    Simultaneous Activity and Subject Recognition: While much of the prior research on the HAR dataset focuses on activity recognition alone, our goal was to simultaneously classify both the activity being performed and the subject performing it. This adds complexity to the model and the evaluation.
    Handling Missing Sensor Data: Missing sensor data is a common problem in real-world applications, where sensors might fail or temporarily lose connection. The HAR dataset was sampled at 50 Hz, and we simulated missing data by randomly removing sensor readings from the accelerometer and gyroscope data over short periods (1-10 seconds). This allowed us to investigate the impact of missing data on the performance of our model.

Methodology
Model Architecture

We used Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network, which is well-suited for time-series data like the HAR dataset. The LSTM model was trained to classify both the activity and subject simultaneously, making use of the temporal relationships in the data.
Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the model was evaluated using accuracy for both activity and subject recognition tasks. We compared the results under different conditions:

    Baseline model without missing data.
    Model performance with missing sensor data.
    Model performance with imputed sensor data using two imputation techniques: SimpleImputer and KNNImputer.

Data Imputation

We simulated missing data by removing random accelerometer and gyroscope readings for short periods. Two imputation methods were employed:

    SimpleImputer: Fills missing values using statistical methods such as the mean or median.
    KNNImputer: Uses the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to impute missing values based on the values of the nearest samples.

Additionally, we explored the impact of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on imputation performance by reducing the dimensionality of the data before applying the imputation techniques.
Results
Activity Recognition

For activity recognition, the baseline model achieved an accuracy of 93%. When sensor data was randomly removed (simulating sensor failure), the accuracy dropped to 78%. However, when the missing data was imputed using the SimpleImputer and KNNImputer techniques, the accuracy improved to 90%, indicating that imputation helped recover some of the lost information.
Subject Recognition

Subject recognition was more challenging, with the baseline model achieving an accuracy of 80%. With missing data, the accuracy decreased to 61%. After imputing the missing data, the accuracy improved to 73%. The class-wise subject recognition accuracy revealed that sitting, standing, and laying activities were particularly challenging, as these activities are stationary and might appear very similar across subjects.
Missing Data Simulation Results:

    Activity Recognition:
        Baseline Accuracy: 93%
        Accuracy with Missing Data: 78%
        Accuracy with Imputed Data: 90%
    Subject Recognition:
        Baseline Accuracy: 80%
        Accuracy with Missing Data: 61%
        Accuracy with Imputed Data: 73%

Discussion

Our results demonstrate that while the HAR dataset is primarily designed for activity recognition, it can also be used for subject recognition with a suitable approach. The uneven distribution of subjects in the dataset posed a challenge, but by ensuring that both training and testing datasets contained all 30 subjects, we achieved reasonable performance.

The presence of missing data significantly impacted the performance of both the activity and subject recognition tasks. However, the imputation techniques, especially KNNImputer, showed promising results in recovering the missing data and improving the model's performance. The challenges in recognizing stationary activities like sitting, standing, and laying were also noted, as these activities tend to exhibit similar sensor patterns across different subjects.
Conclusion

This study highlights the potential of using LSTM networks for simultaneous activity and subject recognition in the HAR dataset. We also explored the impact of missing sensor data on model performance and demonstrated that imputation techniques can mitigate some of the negative effects. Future work can focus on refining the imputation methods, exploring additional sensor data, and improving the model's ability to recognize stationary activities with higher accuracy.
